# ThemeManagerHelper

This tool hopefully makes managing themes for boformer's [Building Themes](https://github.com/boformer/BuildingThemes) mod easier to use. 

Themes can be added by linking a Steam collection, and as long as the assets are subscribed, they'll be added to a new theme.

The main tools used for this were Electron, React and built using Webpack.
Looking for assistance and teaching on how to get this built for OSX and Linux!
